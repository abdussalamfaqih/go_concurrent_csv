# go_concurrent_csv
## Project to Process Input CSV using Goroutine

The code accepts input of csv file to process and generate output. It uses concurrency to handle each process with pipeline pattern. 

To run the code, use `go run main.go` command, and `go build` to buld the package,
if Go is already installed in the system.

The alternative if Go is not installed, is using generated binary file. To run, use `./go_csv_concurrent` command.
